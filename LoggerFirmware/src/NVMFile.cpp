 *  \brief Generic Non-voltile Memory file storage for string data
 *
 * The logger has a number of instances where it needs to store one or more strings in
 * persistent, non-volatile, storage (typically flash memory of some kind).  This module
 * provides a primitive for this, and specialisations for particular cases.
