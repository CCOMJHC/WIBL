/*!\file serialisation.cpp
 * \brief Implement simple serialisation for SD file storage
 *
 * This implements the interface for serialisation of storage into
 * an SDLib::File of binary packet data.  This is not intended to be
 * very automatic (on the order of Boost::Serialization), but just
 * enough to get packets into the file
