/*!\file HeapMonitor.cpp
 * \brief Helper class to monitor heap memory usage
 *
 * The memory available to the ESP32 can be quite small, and therefore it is important
 * to understand what each component of the system is using for dynamic objects to
 * optimise for this.  This module provides a small object that can be used to interrogate
 * the runtime to provide this information.
