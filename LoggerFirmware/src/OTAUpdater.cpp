 * \brief Adapter to put ESP32 into "over the air" update mode
 *
 * The ESP32 module allows for the firmware to be updated through the WiFi interface
 * through a particular protocol over a standard port.  This module generates the
 * appropriate server objects to allow this to take place.  Note that this is a
 * terminal condition, since the last thing that happens after OTA update is that
 * the system reboots for the new firmware.  Once the system goes into OTA mode,
 * therefore, it does not return.
