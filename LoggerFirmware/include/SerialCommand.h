 *  \brief Interface for command line processing for the application
 *
 *  The logger takes commands on the serial input line from the user application (or
 *  the user if it's connected to a terminal).  This code generates the interface for
 *  executing those commands.

/// \class SerialCommand
/// \brief Implement a simple ASCII command language for the logger
///
/// The \a SerialCommand object encapsulates a simple command language for the logger,
/// which relies on ASCII commands provided over the Arduino "Serial" object, or (if connected
/// to a client) the Bluetooth LE UART service.  Output from the commands is routed to the
/// Arduino "Serial" UART, and possibly the BLE UART if connected and appropriate.
///
/// The code stores copies of the pointers for the logger and status LED controllers, but does
/// not manage them.  The pointer for the BLE object is managed locally.
///
/// Like most Arduino code, the \a ProcessCommand method needs to be called regularly to
/// check for commands, and execute them.
