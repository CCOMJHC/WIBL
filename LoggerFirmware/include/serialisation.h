/*!\file serialisation.h
 * \brief Simple serialisation of basic types for SD card storage
 *
 * As part of the logging process, we have to put together binary packets
 * of the input data for storage on the SD card, so that we economise on
 * the space taken per packet (and therefore get the most data per MB).
 * In order to provide some central capability for this, the Serialisable
 * type is used to encapsulate a packet of data to be written, and the
 * Serialiser class can be used to provide the overall encapsulation of
 * data type, length byte, checksum, etc. as required.
