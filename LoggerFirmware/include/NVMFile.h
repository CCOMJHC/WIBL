/// number of strings in the non-volatile memory on the logger.  This class provides a means
/// to centralise that structure.  Note that this class is not generally exposed to the rest
/// of the code, which interacts via the interface classes to either read or write, but not
/// both together.

/// The logger can be used to store a JSON string with the platform-specific metadata
/// for the ship collecting the data.  This is written into the data files, allowing
/// the post-processing software to set up detailled, rather than general metadata
/// for the ship.
///     Note that the class does not attempt to check what's in the metadata, and just
/// stores what's given, and replicates it into the data.  What it should be, however,
/// is valid JSON in the format specified in IHO B-12 (Crowdsourced Bathymetry Working
/// Group guidelines) for the "platform" element, surrounded by a standard "{ ... }"
/// braces to make it a valid JSON document on its own (otherwise it can't be converted
/// into a Python dictionary using the standard JSON library).
///     Since the metadata string is stored as a single line in a file in non-volatile
/// memory, it's important that the JSON is all in one line, rather than being formatted
/// with spaces/tabs/carriage returns, etc.

/// \class ScalesStore
/// \brief Specialisation of NVMFile for sensor scale factors
///
/// The logger can have multiple sensors that store their data in binary (or binary-coded) form,
/// needing scale factors applied before they become either usable floating-point data, or converted
/// into the right units.  This store allows the code to provide one or more JSON fragments of
/// scale factors to be stored for transmission into the output data files whenever a file is
/// started.

/// \brief Specialisation of NVMFile for algorithm request storage
///
/// The logger can store a list of algorithms that should be applied to the data in post-processing
/// in order to correct any problems that might be generated by the specific circumstances of the
/// ship collecting the data.  There's no guarantee that the post-processing implementation will
/// have the algorithms, or that it will run them, but at least the request is made.
///     The algorithms are specified by a name and a parameter string.  There is no interpretation on
/// how the parameter string should be formatted, since only the algorithm needs to read it.

/// \brief Specialisation of NVMFile for NMEA0183 allowed ID storage
///
/// In order to optimise the storage on the logger, the user can specify a list of the NMEA0183 message IDs
/// (the three-letter names that occur after the talked identifier in the messages) that should be written to
/// the data log files; all messages not in the list are ignored (except if there's an empty list, which
/// implicitly means that all messages should be accepted for logging).
///     The algorithm here does not check the message IDs provided for validity, case sensitivity, etc., and
/// filters against what the user provides.  The user is responsible for making sure that the names provided
/// actually make sense.
