 * \brief Main code for a NMEA0183 message handler with time, position, depth logging and timestamping
 *
 * This code is designed to form a simple data logger for NMEA0183, which keeps track of time and stores
 * position, depth, and some environmental information into the SD card attached to the board.  The goal
 * here is to store sufficient information to make this a useful crowd-sourced bathymetry logging engine,
 * but at the cheapest possible price.
