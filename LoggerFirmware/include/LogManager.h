 * \brief Objects to manage the log files, and writing data to them
 *
 * In order to ensure that multiple different loggers can write into the same output file, this
 * code centralises all of the access for log files, making new files, writing to them, removing
 * them as required, etc.

// The maximum number of log files here is relatively arbitrary, although depending on the file
// system being used on the SD card, it might be problematic for the number to be above 1,000
// (since the number is the file extension).  If this becomes a problem, it would be necessary to
// change the way that the file names are constructed (in MakeLogName() in this case, but possibly
// also elsewhere).  A likely scenario for this would be if there was a very large SD card being
// used, where the total file space (MaxLogFiles * MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE) was significantly smaller
// than the size of the card.  With the default size of 10MB files and 1,000 files, this is about
