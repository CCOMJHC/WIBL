# Main application code for a Flask-based RESTful interface to a metadata database
#
# Once data is being uploaded into the WIBL cloud segment, the Trusted node (and potentially
# data collectors) will want to know that the files have been correctly processed, and then
# uploaded.  This code builds a Flask-based application that exposes a REST API for update
# and management of the metadata in a SQLite database, so that the processing and upload code
# can provide information on the files being manipulated, and another website can be used to
# front this information for the Trusted Node, and provide manipulation tools.  This is
# intentionally very minimal, since we want it to run on as limited a resource as possible.
