## \file config.py
# \brief Handle configuration files
#
# The cloud processing code needs a number of external parameters to work out where to find the data,
# where to store intermediate files, and so on.  These are summarised in a JSON configuration file that
# should be installed in the same directory as the serverless handler.  The code here handles reading
# this configuration into a dictionary, and then doing any preliminary processing required to get the
# configuration ready for use (e.g., converting strings to actual values, pre-computing values from
# raw inputs, etc.).

## Read a JSON-format configuration file for the algorithm
#
# In order to allow the user to specify arbitrary configuration parameters, the configuration file
# is a simple JSON structure that can contain any key-value pairs.  Although most of these are
# specific to the algorithm being run, there are a few that control the algorithm:
#   elapsed_time_width  Width (bits) of the elapsed time data in the WIBL file (usu. 32)
#   verbose             Boolean for verbose reporting of processing (usu. False)
#   local               Boolean for local testing (usu. False for cloud deployment)
#   fault_limit         Limit on number of fault messages that are reported before starting to summarise
#
# \param config_file
# \return JSON-file converted into a dictionary (per JSON library)
