##\module deduplicate
# \brief Algorithm for deplicating depth values in the provided data
#
# On some systems, it's possible to get duplicated depths from the echosounder or control
# system (typically because the system is generating positions every second, and the depths
# aren't being updated that fast).  This algorithm does an exhaustive check through all
# of the depths provided in sequence, and provides a boolean NumPy vector that provides an
# indication whether the depth is valid (True) or can be dropped (False).  The original data
# is not modified.
