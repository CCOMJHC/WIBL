# \brief Drive the conversion and time-stamping of logger binary files with output in GeoJSON
#
# The low-cost data loggers generate data as binary outputs which are time referenced to the logger's
# internal reference time.  For submission into the DCDB database, we need it to be referenced to UTC,
# and we need to interpolate the positioning data to the times of the depth measurements recorded; we
# also need to convert to GeoJSON so that it can be pulled into their databases more easily.  This script
# orchestrates this process for a single file, and is expected to run as an AWS Lambda in response to
# the file being uploaded into an incoming S3 bucket.  The output goes into a "well known" S3 bucket
# that is used to stage data before it goes off to DCDB (via another Lambda).
