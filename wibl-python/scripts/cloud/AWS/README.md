# WIBL AWS processing setup instructions and usage
The following instructions describe how to setup WIBL processing lambdas and WIBL manager
web service in AWS.

## Setup
The following scripts will use the AWS CLI to provision the S3 buckets, lambdas, and ECS cluster needed to
run WIBL AWS processing services. Before running these scripts, make sure your AWS user has the following
permissions policies attached to it:
- AmazonEC2FullAccess
- AmazonECS_FullAccess
- AmazonElasticFileSystemFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonSSMFullAccess
- AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess
- AWSLambda_FullAccess
- AmazonSNSFullAccess

### 1. Edit configuration
Edit `configuration-parameters.sh` as needed. The main thing you will probably need to do change
is the `DCDB_PROVIER_ID` variable. Once you do this, make sure your DCDB authorization key
is placed in a file named `ingest-external-${DCDB_PROVIDER_ID}.txt` in the same directory as
`configuration-parameters.sh`.

### 2. Create S3 buckets
Run `configure-buckets.sh` to create S3 buckets for incoming WIBL files and staging/outgoing
GeoJSON files:
```shell
$ ./configure-buckets.sh
```

### 3. Create SNS topics
Run `configure-sns.sh` to create SNS topics that will be used to orchestrate WIBL file processing
lambdas:
```shell
$ ./configure-sns.sh
```

### 4. Configure WIBL manager and frontend ECS services
Run `configure-manager-ecs.sh` to create WIBL manager ECS service. This will also create all VPC
resources needed to run WIBL processing lambdas:
```shell
$ ./configure-manager-ecs.sh
```

#### Update WIBL manager and frontend ECS services
Run `update-manager-ecs.sh` to re-build the manager container image, push it to ECR, and force a new deployment
of `wibl-manager-ecs-svc` ECS service:
```shell
$ ./update-manager-ecs.sh
```

Run `update-frontend-ecs.sh` to re-build the frontend container image, push it to ECR, and force a new deployment
of `wibl-frontend-ecs-svc` ECS service:
```shell
$ ./update-frontend-ecs.sh
```

In either case, when the new deployment is successful, the existing deployment will be de-provisioned. If the
new deployment fails, the existing deployment will be left in place. You can use "Tasks" section of the ECS console
service page to "filter by desired status: Stopped", which will let you find failed deployments and view their logs.

### 5. Configure WIBL processing lambdas
Run `configure-lambdas.sh` to create WIBL processing lambdas and SNS subscriptions needed to 
trigger them:
```shell
$ ./configure-lambdas.sh
```

#### Update WIBL processing lambda code
Run `update-lambda-code.sh` to update code for the WIBL processing lambdas after they 
have been created:
```shell
$ ./update-lambda-code.sh
```

### 6. Configure WIBL visualization lambda code
Run `configure-vizlambda.sh` to create WIBL visualization lambda:
```shell
$ ./configure-vizlambda.sh
```

> For more information on using the visulization lambda, see "Running vizualization lambda" below.

### 7. Configure test EC2 instances (Optional)
Run `configure-ec2-test-instance.sh` to create EC2 instances on the private and public subnet
of the WIBL VPC. These EC2 instances can use useful for testing and debugging WIBL manager and 
processing service lambdas:
```shell
$ ./configure-ec2-test-instance.sh
```

## Usage

1. First upload a WIBL file into the WIBL incoming S3 bucket, for example a WIBL file named 
`6FF5B14E-65F3-4BFD-85D1-50F8CA02BC0B.wibl`.

2. Then trigger WIBL file conversion by issuing an HTTPS request to the conversion start lambda:
```shell
curl -v \
'https://fdjofdjofewjofjo5546jogfljfdlmfl3368.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"object": "6FF5B14E-65F3-4BFD-85D1-50F8CA02BC0B.wibl"}'
```

> Note the URL of the conversion start lambda can be obtained from the `$CONVERSION_START_URL` environment variable
> within `configure-lambdas.sh`, or by running: 
> `echo "$(cat ${WIBL_BUILD_LOCATION}/create_url_lambda_conversion_start.json | jq -r '.FunctionUrl')".` 

This will result in the length of the file being returned via the HTTP response:
```
content-length: 63641
```

Further, if successful, the conversion start lambda will publish a message to the conversion SNS topic, which
will cause the conversion lambda to be invoked.

### Running vizualization lambda
The [vizualization lambda](../../../wibl/visualization/cloud/aws/lambda_function.py) allows multiple
GeoJSON files stored in $STAGING_BUCKET to be combined and vizualized over GEBCO data using 
[Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org) and written to $VIZ_BUCKET. 
The script [vizlambdainvoke.py](../../../scripts/vizlambdainvoke.py) shows how to invoke this lambda (make sure
to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables before running).

When invoking the visualisation lambda, you may get the following error:
```
botocore.errorfactory.ResourceNotReadyException: An error occurred (ResourceNotReadyException) when calling the Invoke operation (reached max retries: 4): Resources for the function are being restored.
```

This can happen if the lambda hasn't been run in a while. Try again after a few minutes.

> Note: Any service wishing to invoke this lambda will need to setup a [resources-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html).
