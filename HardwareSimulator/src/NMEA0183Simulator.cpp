 * \brief Generate faked NMEA0183-formated data on the software serial output line
 *
 * This generates example NMEA0183 data for a GNSS with depth sounder on a single line,
 * changing the position and depth as a function of time.  The position information is
 * passed out at 1Hz, and the depth data at 0.5-1.0Hz (randomly).  The position and depth
 * are changed over time, with suitable constraints to maintain consistency.
