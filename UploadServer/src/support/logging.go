/*! @file logging.go
 * @brief Simple structured logging with string formatting.
 *
 * In order to provide systematic logging with formatting, this module provides support
 * code to generate syslog(1)-like logging levels.  This might not be the best way to do
 * this (according to the Go book), but it works well enough for simple cases.
