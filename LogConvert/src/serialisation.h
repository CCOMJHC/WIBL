 * \brief Simple serialisation of basic types for file storage
 *
 * As part of the logging process, we have to put together binary packets
 * of the input data for storage.  In order to provide some central capability
 * for this, the Serialisable type is used to encapsulate a packet of data to
 * be written, and the Serialiser class can be used to provide the overall
 * encapsulation of data type, length byte, checksum, etc. as required.
